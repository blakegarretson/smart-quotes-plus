# smart-quotes-plus package

This package replaces straight quotes with smart unicode curly quotes, as well as a few other handy replacements.  This lets you type with the usual `"` and `'` quotes, but quickly convert them to smart `‘curly’ “quotes”` quotes at the end.  You clearly would only want to run this on prose.
